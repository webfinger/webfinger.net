## Link Relation: profile-page ##

The link relation `http://webfinger.net/rel/profile-page` identifies the main
home/profile page that a human should visit when getting info about that
webfinger account. It says nothing about the content-type (or microformats),
but it's likely text/html if it's for users. But maybe it's just Flash, for
instance.
